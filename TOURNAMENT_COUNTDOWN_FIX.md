# Tournament Countdown Timer Fix

## Issue
The auto-deletion timer was starting immediately when the tournament was created, rather than starting after the tournament's scheduled start time.

## Problem Details
- Tournament scheduled for 12:13 AM
- Tournament created at 12:12 AM
- Timer was showing "Auto-delete in 1m 54s" immediately after creation
- **Expected behavior**: Timer should only start counting down AFTER 12:13 AM (scheduled start time)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated TournamentCountdown Component
- Added `startDate` prop to accept the tournament's scheduled start time
- Modified countdown logic to check if tournament has started before showing deletion timer
- Shows "Tournament not started" message before the scheduled start time
- Only starts auto-deletion countdown after the tournament's scheduled start time

### 2. Updated Component Usage
- `TournamentHeader.tsx`: Pass `tournament.start_date` to TournamentCountdown
- `TournamentCard.tsx`: Pass combined `tournament.date` and `tournament.time` to TournamentCountdown

### 3. Updated Tournament Time Utils
- Modified `getTournamentDeletionWarning` function to only show warnings after tournament has started
- Ensures warnings are only displayed when both tournament has started AND deletion time is approaching

### 4. Updated Documentation
- Added clarification about countdown behavior in implementation docs
- Updated PowerShell revert script to include all changed files

## Key Changes Made

### TournamentCountdown.tsx
```typescript
interface TournamentCountdownProps {
  ttl?: string;
  startDate?: string; // NEW: Tournament scheduled start date
  className?: string;
  showIcon?: boolean;
  showWarning?: boolean;
}

// Added logic to check if tournament has started before showing countdown
if (startDate) {
  const tournamentStartTime = new Date(startDate);
  const hasStarted = now.getTime() >= tournamentStartTime.getTime();
  
  if (!hasStarted) {
    setTimeRemaining("Not started");
    return;
  }
}
```

### tournamentTimeUtils.ts
```typescript
// Only show warning if tournament has started and less than 1 minute remaining
if (hasStarted && timeRemaining < 1 * 60 * 1000) {
  return `⚠️ This tournament will be automatically deleted in ${formattedTime}.`;
}
```

## Result
- ✅ Timer now shows "Tournament not started" before scheduled start time
- ✅ Auto-deletion countdown only begins after tournament's scheduled start time
- ✅ Warnings and notifications respect the tournament start time
- ✅ Maintains the 2-minute auto-deletion window for testing (after start time)

## Testing
1. Create a tournament scheduled for a future time
2. Before start time: Should show "Tournament not started" 
3. After start time: Should show "Auto-delete in 2m 0s" and count down
4. Warnings appear only when both: tournament has started AND deletion time is approaching
