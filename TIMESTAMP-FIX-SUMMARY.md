# React Timestamp Error Fix

## Problem
The React app was crashing with the error:
```
Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {seconds, nanoseconds})
```

## Root Cause
Firestore returns timestamp fields as Firestore Timestamp objects with `{seconds, nanoseconds}` structure, but the React components were trying to render these objects directly as strings in JSX, which React doesn't allow.

## Files Fixed
1. **src/pages/Tournaments.tsx** - Fixed tournament date formatting in both joined and hosted tournaments
2. **src/pages/HostedTournaments.tsx** - Fixed tournament date formatting 
3. **src/pages/Index.tsx** - Fixed tournament date formatting in home page
4. **src/pages/Profile.tsx** - Fixed tournament date display in profile page (2 instances)

## Solution Applied
For each file, I updated the tournament data mapping to properly convert Firestore timestamps to strings:

```typescript
// Before (BROKEN):
date: tournament.start_date, // This could be a Firestore Timestamp object

// After (FIXED):
let startDate: Date;
if (typeof tournament.start_date === 'string') {
  startDate = new Date(tournament.start_date);
} else if (tournament.start_date && typeof tournament.start_date === 'object' && 'toDate' in tournament.start_date) {
  // Handle Firestore Timestamp
  startDate = (tournament.start_date as any).toDate();
} else {
  startDate = new Date(); // Fallback
}

date: startDate.toISOString(),
time: startDate.toLocaleTimeString([], { hour: '2-digit', minute: '2-digit' }),
```

## Additional Utility Created
Created `src/utils/firestore.ts` with helper functions to safely handle Firestore timestamps:
- `convertFirestoreTimestamp()` - Safely converts Firestore timestamps to Date objects or ISO strings
- `formatFirestoreDate()` - Formats Firestore timestamps for display
- `sanitizeTournamentData()` - Helper to sanitize tournament data from Firestore

## Result
The React app should no longer crash due to timestamp rendering issues. All tournament dates are now properly converted to strings before being passed to React components.

## Prevention
To prevent this issue in the future:
1. Always use the utility functions in `src/utils/firestore.ts` when working with Firestore data
2. Never directly assign Firestore Timestamp objects to React component props
3. Always convert timestamps to strings or Date objects before rendering
