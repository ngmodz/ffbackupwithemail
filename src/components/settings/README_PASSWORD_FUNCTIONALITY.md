/**
 * Password Change Functionality Implementation
 * 
 * This implementation provides comprehensive password management for Firebase authentication:
 * 
 * 1. CHANGE PASSWORD FLOW:
 *    - User enters current password, new password, and confirms new password
 *    - System validates password strength (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char)
 *    - Firebase reauthenticates user with current password for security
 *    - Password is updated in Firebase Auth
 *    - User receives success confirmation
 * 
 * 2. FORGOT PASSWORD FLOW:
 *    - User clicks "Forgot Password?" link
 *    - System pre-fills current user's email address
 *    - User can modify email if needed
 *    - Firebase sends password reset email to the specified address
 *    - User receives confirmation that email was sent
 *    - User can follow email instructions to reset password
 * 
 * 3. SECURITY FEATURES:
 *    - Current password verification required for changes
 *    - Strong password validation
 *    - Firebase reauthentication prevents session hijacking
 *    - Proper error handling for various scenarios
 * 
 * 4. USER EXPERIENCE:
 *    - Real-time password validation feedback
 *    - Clear error messages
 *    - Loading states during operations
 *    - Responsive design for mobile and desktop
 * 
 * USAGE:
 * - Change Password: Settings > Security > Change Password
 * - Forgot Password: Available in both Settings and during password change
 * 
 * COMPONENTS:
 * - ChangePasswordDialog: Main password change interface
 * - ForgotPasswordDialog: Email-based password reset
 * - Settings: Integrated password management in user settings
 * 
 * FIREBASE INTEGRATION:
 * - Uses Firebase Auth updatePassword() and reauthenticateWithCredential()
 * - Sends password reset emails via sendPasswordResetEmail()
