## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: CashFree Account Setup

1. **Create CashFree Account**:
   - Visit [CashFree Merchant Dashboard](https://merchant.cashfree.com)
   - Sign up for a new account or log in to existing account

2. **Get API Credentials**:
   - Navigate to Developers → API Keys
   - Generate sandbox credentials for testing
   - Generate production credentials for live payments

3. **Configure Webhooks**:
   - Go to Developers → Webhooks
   - Add webhook URL: `https://yourdomain.com/.netlify/functions/payment-webhook`
   - Enable relevant events: `ORDER_PAID`, `PAYMENT_SUCCESS`, `PAYMENT_FAILED`
   - It is highly recommended to also set a webhook secret token for security.

### Step 2: Environment Configuration

1. **Copy Environment File**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Update Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # CashFree Credentials (from merchant dashboard)
   VITE_CASHFREE_APP_ID="your_actual_app_id"
   CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY="your_actual_secret_key"
   
   # Environment (SANDBOX for testing, PRODUCTION for live)
   VITE_CASHFREE_ENVIRONMENT="SANDBOX"
   
   # Webhook Secret (from webhook configuration)
   CASHFREE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="your_webhook_secret"
   
   # Your domain URLs
   VITE_APP_URL="https://yourdomain.com"
   VITE_RETURN_URL="https://yourdomain.com/payment-status"
   ```

3. **Firebase Service Account** (for Netlify functions):
   ```bash
   FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT='{"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project-id",...}'
   ```

### Step 3: Deployment Configuration

1. **Netlify Environment Variables**:
   - Add all environment variables to Netlify dashboard
   - Ensure webhook URLs are accessible from CashFree servers

2. **Domain Configuration**:
   - Update `VITE_RETURN_URL` to your production domain
   - Configure CORS settings if needed

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Webhook Signature Verification
```javascript
function verifyCashFreeSignature(rawBody, signature, timestamp) {
  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secretKey)
    .update(timestamp + rawBody)
    .digest('base64');
    
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(signature, 'base64'),
    Buffer.from(expectedSignature, 'base64')
  );
}
```

# CashFree Payment Verification System

This document describes the implementation of the payment verification system using CashFree API keys.

## Overview

The system verifies payments through the CashFree payment gateway and adds credits to users' accounts upon successful payment. It consists of several components:

1. **API Functions**:
   - `verify-payment.js`: Verifies payment status with CashFree and updates user wallet
   - `payment-webhook.js`: Handles payment status webhooks from CashFree

2. **Vercel API Routes**:
   - `api/verify-payment.js`: Server-side function to verify payments
   - `api/payment-webhook.js`: Handles CashFree webhook notifications

3. **Frontend Services**:
   - `paymentService.ts`: Handles payment verification on the client side
   - `cashfreeService.ts`: Manages CashFree SDK integration

4. **UI Components**:
   - `PaymentStatusPage.tsx`: Displays payment verification status
   - `PaymentStatus.tsx`: Simplified payment status page

## Payment Verification Flow

1. User initiates a payment through the CashFree gateway
2. After payment completion, user is redirected to the payment status page
3. The system verifies the payment status with CashFree API using API keys
4. If payment is successful, credits are added to the user's account
5. The UI displays the updated credit balance and payment status

## Key Features

- **Double Verification**: Payments are verified both via redirect parameters and API calls
- **Automatic Retry**: System retries verification if payment status is pending
- **Transaction Records**: All credit transactions are recorded in the database
- **Real-time UI Updates**: Credit balance updates are reflected immediately in the UI
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for failed payments

## Configuration

The system requires the following environment variables in your Vercel project:

```
VITE_CASHFREE_APP_ID=<your-cashfree-app-id>
CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY=<your-cashfree-secret-key>
CASHFREE_ENVIRONMENT=<SANDBOX or PRODUCTION>
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=<your-firebase-service-account-json>
```

## Security Considerations

- CashFree webhook signatures are verified cryptographically
- User transactions are protected using Firebase security rules
- All API requests are authenticated and validated
- Payment details are logged for audit purposes

## Database Schema

### Payment Orders
```
paymentOrders/{orderId}
  - orderId: string
  - userId: string
  - amount: number
  - orderStatus: string
  - paymentDetails: object
  - orderTags: object
  - createdAt: timestamp
  - updatedAt: timestamp
```

### Credit Transactions
```
creditTransactions/{transactionId}
  - userId: string
  - type: string
  - amount: number
  - value: number
  - balanceBefore: number
  - balanceAfter: number
  - walletType: string
  - description: string
  - transactionDetails: object
  - createdAt: timestamp
```

### User Wallet
```
users/{userId}
  - wallet: {
      tournamentCredits: number,
      hostCredits: number,
      earnings: number,
      totalPurchasedTournamentCredits: number,
      totalPurchasedHostCredits: number,
      firstPurchaseCompleted: boolean,
      lastUpdated: timestamp
    }
```

## Vercel Deployment

For detailed deployment instructions, please refer to [VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md](./VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Backend Configuration

1.  **`CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY`**: Your CashFree secret key.
2.  **`FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`**: Your Firebase service account JSON.
3.  **`ADMIN_SECRET_KEY`**: A secret key for administrative actions.

### Deployment

- Ensure all environment variables are set in your Vercel project dashboard.
- The Vercel deployment will automatically use the `api` directory for serverless functions.

## Common Issues

1. **Solution**:
    1.  Double-check your `VITE_CASHFREE_APP_ID` and `CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY` in your environment variables.
    2.  Ensure the keys are for the correct environment (Test/Production).
    3.  Enable development logging by checking browser console and Vercel function logs.

2. **Solution**:
    1.  Verify the webhook URL in your CashFree dashboard is `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/payment-webhook`.
    2.  Check for any errors in the webhook logs on the CashFree dashboard.
    3.  Check browser console and Vercel function logs.
