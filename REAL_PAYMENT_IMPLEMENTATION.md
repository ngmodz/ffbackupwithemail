## Changes Made

   - Removed `forceVerifyTestPayment` method from `PaymentService.ts`
   - Removed test payment handling from `verify-payment.js`
   - Deleted `mock-create-payment-order.js`

2. **Enhanced Real Payment Verification**
   - Updated `verify-payment.js` to handle both GET and POST requests
   - Improved webhook handling in `payment-webhook.js`
   - Updated `CashFreeService.verifyPayment()` to use POST method

3. **Documentation**
   - Created `CASHFREE_WEBHOOK_SETUP.md` guide for setting up webhooks
   - Created this implementation summary

## Required Environment Variables

For the payment integration to work correctly, you need to set the following environment variables in your Vercel project:

```
# CashFree API Credentials
VITE_CASHFREE_APP_ID=your_app_id
CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
CASHFREE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret

# Environment (SANDBOX or PRODUCTION)
CASHFREE_ENVIRONMENT=SANDBOX
VITE_CASHFREE_ENVIRONMENT=SANDBOX

# Application URLs
VITE_APP_URL=https://your-app-domain.com
VITE_API_URL=https://your-app-domain.com/api
```

## Setup Steps

1. **Deploy the Application**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

2. **Configure CashFree Webhooks**
   - Follow the instructions in `CASHFREE_WEBHOOK_SETUP.md`
   - Ensure the webhook URL points to `https://your-app-domain.com/api/payment-webhook`

3. **Test the Integration**
   - Make a test purchase in the Sandbox environment
   - Verify that credits are added to the user's account
   - Check the webhook logs to ensure proper processing

4. **Switch to Production**
   - Update environment variables to use Production credentials
   - Configure Production webhooks in CashFree dashboard

## Payment Flow

1. **User initiates purchase**
   - User clicks on a credit package
   - `CreditPackageCard` calls `PaymentService.initiateCashFreeCheckout()`

2. **Order is created**
   - `CashFreeService.createOrder()` calls `/api/create-payment-order`
   - Server creates order with CashFree API
   - Order details are returned with payment session ID

3. **Checkout popup opens**
   - `CashFreeService.openCheckout()` opens CashFree popup
   - User completes payment
   - User is redirected to payment status page

4. **Payment verification**
   - Status page calls `PaymentService.verifyPayment()`
   - Server calls CashFree API to verify payment status
   - If paid, credits are added to user's account

5. **Webhook handling**
   - CashFree sends webhook to `/api/payment-webhook`
   - Server verifies webhook signature
   - Credits are added to user's account (if not already done)

## Files Modified

- `src/components/credits/CreditPackageCard.tsx`
- `src/lib/paymentService.ts`
- `src/lib/cashfreeService.ts`
- `api/verify-payment.js`
- `api/payment-webhook.js`

## Files Added

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the payment integration, check:

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required variables are correctly set
2. **Webhook Configuration**: Verify webhook URL and events are properly configured
3. **API Logs**: Check server logs for any errors during payment processing
4. **CashFree Dashboard**: Review payment status in the CashFree merchant dashboard
